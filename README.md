# MFCBDAINF

MCFBDAINF is a GUI version of the command line version available from here http://www.dvbstreamexplorer.com/dvbse/download.php

It will scan your Windows system for BDA DTV hardware and collect information about the topology of BDA hardware. Developers of BDA compatible software can use this application for troubleshooting purposes. I.e. if your application is failing to build the graph for a BDA device, getting to know the topology of the device might be useful in solving the problem. Information can be saved as XML document and loaded back again. This allows you to exchange information with users at remote locations. Proprietary GUID's from TBS, Hauppauge, DVBWorld and FireDTV are recognized.
To fully understand the output produced by this application you should read the "Broadcast Driver Architecture Drivers" section in Windows Driver Kit.
